# AlgoViz

Desktop application to help you visualize basic algorithms, like searching algorithms, graph algorithms and linear data structures.

Written as part of the semester project during the 1st semester of 3rd year in college. 
Algortihms supported:
1. Search algorithms
    * Linear search
    * Sequential search
2. Graph algorithms
    * Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
    * Breath-first search
    * Depth-first search
    * Kruskal's minimum spanning tree
    * Prim's minimum spanning tree
3. Linear data structures
    * Queue
    * Stack

## Motivation?
That **one credit** needed to pass the semester.

## Demo
A quick demonstration video of the application.

## Quick start
**_For Windows OS_**

1. Please download Visual Studio Community Edition. Any version will do.
2. Make sure you have downloaded and installed QT 5.15.2 (MSVC compiler x86 component) on your system. 
3. Install Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0)
4. After downloding (cloning) the source code, open the AlgoViz.sln file with Visual Studio.
5. Make sure that the Visual Studio IDE recognizes the QT installation directory and the QT's MSVC compiler directory. This can be configured through the project settings.
6. Click on the small green 'run without debugging' button at the top of the IDE to build and run the project.

**_For UNIX systems_**

For all the linux and mac OS users out there I'm sorry. I couldn't write a proper CMake file to help you build the project. A simple google search will lead you to way better algorithm viualizer apps out there. 

## Technical details
* Language and framework: C++ 11 standard, QT 5.15.2
* Compiler: MSVC compiler
